# Prediction-of-Phishing-website
Prediction of phishing website using ML deployed locally using flask in python
This Algorithm based on Numerical Tested already parameters which gives works on Numerical values so no need for alpha numeric conversion of the Data set is required.
1. The entire parameters consists of 0,-1,1
2. This Prediction is done 4 basic classification algorithm are:
  i.   Naive bayes
  ii.  Logistic Regression
  iii. Decision Tree
  iv.  Random Forest
3. All the above algorithm are compared with the accuracy rate then the most high accurate algorithm is choosed and deployed.
4. Random forest is more accurate algorithm with accuracy rate=89% .
5. The pickle file of the randomforest model is invoked and used in flask algorithm
